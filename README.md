# NaturalDisasters
This is a Minecraft spigot server plugin that will create an acid rainstorm that will slowly damage players who are in the server. There are 5 levels of storms, which are varied by length. There are two commands:
/startacid [seconds] 
will start a storm which would last for the amount of seconds given.
